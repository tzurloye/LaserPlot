# LaserPlot

This Shiny application allows the user to explore a data file outputted from the Levitation Laser Furnace. Once loaded, the user can view the temperature vs time plot and download it as a pdf or png file. They also have the option to include linear regressions over the cooling or heating periods and their accompanying equations on the plot, where the slope represents the rate of change. The rates are also shown on the right, calculated by averaging the derivatives throughout the cooling or heating periods. The user also has the option to download a single-row table in csv format.
